# Software-Engineering
This is from my Software Engineering class. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Leaflet.js, Python (Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group, or MGGG code), Spring)

Frontend - Sylvia Lee
Backend - Mohammed Rayeesuddin
Preprocessing - Darren Lo
SeaWulf (Postprocessing and MGGG) - Sean Xia

I specifically worked with the GerryChain library provided by the MGGG group. The repository can be found here: "https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain" while the documents I used to learn are included here: "https://mggg.github.io/GerryChain/" for reference. I attempted to use GerryChainJulia (https://github.com/mggg/GerryChainJulia) with tutorial (https://mggg.github.io/GerryChainJulia/stable/) for supposed performance benefits but was not treated kindly during the Julia installation and ran into other problems trying to use other libraries such as pcompress (https://github.com/mggg/pcompress) and gerrytools (https://github.com/mggg/gerrytools) for reruns of runs and generating high quality visualizations respectively.
